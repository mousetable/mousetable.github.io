            <p class="text">
              We developed a detachable mouse table enabling temperature regulation during combined x-ray computed tomography and optical 
              imaging sessions. The 3D-printed table allows seamless transportation of anesthetized mice between imaging modalities while 
              maintaining consistent animal positioning and posture. An integrated carbon nanotube heating pad under the mouse sustainably 
              warms the body to optimal temperature without interfering with x-ray imaging or introducing artifacts. This table optimizes 
              multimodal preclinical imaging workflows and upholds animal welfare standards by facilitating an efficient operational 
              environment and inhibiting hypothermia in anesthetized mice.

              Multimodal imaging has a great utility in cancer research by concurrently providing anatomical, functional, 
              and molecular information in live animals. During preclinical imaging of small animals like mice, anesthesia 
              is required to inhibit animal movement and improve image quality. However, due to their large surface area 
              relative to body weight, mice, especially nude mice, are more susceptible to hypothermia when under anesthesia.
              To address this problem, here we develop a detachable mouse table with a temperature-control function for hybrid 
              x-ray and optical imaging, without introducing CT metal artifacts. Specifically, we design and 3D-print a customized 
              detachable scanning table compatible with both CT and optical imaging systems. It enables seamless transportation 
              of the anesthetized mouse between two imaging modalities. Our design facilitates a streamlined operational 
              environment to accommodate various imaging purposes. The 3D-printed table parts, complemented by a glass cover, 
              securely fix the animal imaging area in place, ensuring consistent positioning and posture of mice for different 
              imaging modalities. With a metal-free carbon nanotube-based heating pad, the table allows sustained warming of the 
              mouse body without inferencing x-ray imaging. Our experiments show the ability of the table system when supporting 
              a 30g water bag at approximately 40℃ over 3 hours, effectively regulating the temperature to an optimal 36℃ during 
              a preclinical imaging session. This imaging table is convenient and effective to use, offering a versatile platform 
              that upholds animal welfare standards.

              In-vivo imaging using micro-computed tomography (micro-CT) has been a critical tool for preclinical research by providing 
              noninvasive, high-resolution 3D imaging. This technology enables detailed visualization of internal structures, from low 
              contrast soft tissues, such as lipid and water, to high contrast materials, such as calcium and iodine, allowing for precise 
              material identification and quantification. Micro-CT has thus become a powerful imaging technique for multiple biological 
              and biomedical research.
            </p>
            <p class="text">
              During micro-CT imaging, small animals, commonly mice, are anesthetized and positioned on a scanning table to prevent 
              movement and minimize examination time. However, the high surface area-to-body weight ratio in these small animals 
              predisposes them to hypothermia under anesthesia. Therefore, maintaining a constant body temperature near the animal’s 
              normal range during imaging is a critical consideration.
            </p>
            <p class="text">
              The key component in achieving this is the design of the scanning table. The table must be equipped with a heating 
              system that not only maintains the required temperature but is also compatible with the imaging system. Particularly challenging 
              is the requirement for the heating subsystem to be devoid of metallic parts within the imaging field. Although the 
              use of photon-counting provides way to reduce metal artefact such as beam hardening during reconstruction, avoiding the use 
              of metal is preferable for achieving optimal imaging results. Another critical design constraint is the need to minimize the 
              dimensions of the scanning table. An increase in the size of the scanning table directly translates to an enlarged scan 
              dimension, which can result in prolonged examination times. This, in turn, leads to an increased dose of radiation exposure 
              to the subject. Therefore, to minimize the radiation exposure for mice, it is essential that the scanning table be designed 
              as compact as possible, ideally approximating, slightly larger than, the size of the mouse itself.

            <h3>3D-printed Table</h3>
            <p class='text'>
              In addressing the need for a compact table size for micro-CT scanning, we have constructed a mouse scanning table using 
              PLA (Polylactic Acid) 3D printing technology for the base structure. As shown in Figure below, the designing of this table 
              includes a base that connects to the gantry of the scanner, a supporting bar, and a bed. The supporting bar extends from 
              the base to hold the bed on which the mouse is placed during scanning. The dimensions of the table are within 50mm in 
              width, 60mm in height, and 200mm in length, in which the cross-section area is slightly larger than the average size of 
              a mouse, ensuring it is compact to facilitate short imaging duration. Additionally, the table is designed to be detachable 
              from the scanner gantry, providing versatility for different projects that may require the scanner.
            </p>

              Building upon this 3D printed structure, we have explored various methods for integrating a heating subsystem. In biomedical 
              research, the commonly used techniques to maintain animal warmth include air heating, fluid heating, and heating pad systems. 
              However, considering the specific constraints of our project, the fluid heating method was ruled out due to the risk of fluid 
              leakage, which could potentially damage the scanner. Consequently, we have focused our attention on the remaining two methods 
              — air heating and heating pad systems.

            <h3>Non-metalic Heating Pad</h3>
            <p class="text">
              The heating pad system primarily features a non-metallic heating pad, which is a carbon nanotubebased flexible electrothermal 
              film heater with high heating efficiency. It has low operational noise and the emission of farinfrared radiation, ensuring 
              that it does not affect the imaging results. This heating pad is composed of three distinct layers, with the central layer 
              being the heating element. This layer is designed to provide uniform heating across its surface, ensuring consistent 
              temperature distribution. The flexible nature of the pad allows for easy adjustment and customization to fit the dimensions 
              of the scanning bed perfectly. An extension cord will be connected to the heating pad at the gantry, serving as the power 
              source for the heating pad.
